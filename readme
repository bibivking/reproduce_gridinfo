To make a gridinfo file and its landmask file, please follow the steps:

1. run converge_grid_elev_std_opt_mask.ncl to get a grid_elev file which all vars use the same landsea 
2. run reverse_lat_lon.ncl to make gridinfo file into a GSWP kind global map
3. run make_landmask_for_mmy_gridinfo.ncl to make landmask file for the gridinfo file
